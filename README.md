# Custom-Game-Tracker-Scraper
 
This tool is a simple app that allows the user to take a saved HTML/HTM file of a tracker.gg custom game and generate a CSV with its data, and entry fields for data that tracker does not provide.

**Ensure the arrangement of .exe files is not disturbed. If moving one, move both.**
*Especially not data_manager.exe - Don't rename that!*

## How to Use

- Open a game.
- Click "Open in new tab"
- Once it is loaded, right-click and "Save page as".
- In the tool, load just the .htm / .html file.
- Enter data. It's self-explanatory from there.

This will generate a .csv file of the stats. Do with that what you will.
